measurement_of_prostate_specific_antigen_level,Clinical description,"Measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level is conducted to screen for or monitor prostate cancer, as elevated levels can indicate the presence or progression of the disease, although other non-cancerous conditions can also cause elevated PSA. The test helps in early detection and management of prostate abnormalities.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash

user_of_morphine,Clinical description,"Morphine use indicates the presence of moderate to severe pain, often stemming from tissue damage, nerve injury, or cancer, leading to its prescription for analgesic purposes. It can also result from recreational drug use leading to physiological and psychological dependence.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
