user_of_warfarin,Clinical description,"Warfarin is an anticoagulant medication used to prevent blood clots in individuals with conditions such as atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism, where the underlying aetiology involves disruption of the normal blood coagulation cascade.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_warfarin,Frequency,"Warfarin use is relatively common, and cases are readily identifiable in real-world healthcare data due to its widespread use for various thromboembolic conditions.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_warfarin,Median age of incident cases,65 to 80 (Individuals typically present later in life as the incidence of atrial fibrillation and other thromboembolic risk factors increases with age.),cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_warfarin,Percentage male,"55% to 65% (Men are slightly more prone to conditions like atrial fibrillation and vascular disease, which often necessitate warfarin therapy.)",cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_warfarin,Survival at five years,50% to 75% (Mortality is influenced by the underlying conditions requiring warfarin therapy and the effectiveness of anticoagulation management.),cohort_survival,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_warfarin,Cohort overlap,"Overlap with acetaminophen (20-40%) and morphine (5-15%) may occur due to their use for pain management, while overlap with prostate-specific antigen testing (10-30%) might be observed in older men. There would be little overlap with users of other anticoagulants.",compare_cohorts,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_warfarin,Cohort timing,"Typically, individuals may be on acetaminophen and morphine for pain management prior to starting warfarin for a thromboembolic event; prostate-specific antigen testing may occur before or concurrently with warfarin initiation as part of routine health screenings. All of the cohorts would be entered with a median timing difference of approximately 1 year.",compare_cohorts,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_warfarin,Frequently seen comorbidities,"Atrial fibrillation, Coronary artery disease, Heart failure, Deep vein thrombosis, Pulmonary embolism, Stroke, Hypertension, Diabetes mellitus, Chronic kidney disease, Peripheral artery disease (These comorbidities are frequently associated with conditions that either predispose individuals to thromboembolic events or share common risk factors with conditions requiring anticoagulation.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_warfarin,Frequently seen signs and symptoms,"Bleeding, Bruising, Hematoma, Hematuria, Melena, Epistaxis, Gingival bleeding, Fatigue, Weakness, Dizziness (These signs and symptoms are indicative of potential bleeding complications associated with warfarin's anticoagulant effects.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_warfarin,Frequently seen medications,"Aspirin, Acetaminophen, Beta blockers, Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, Diuretics, Statins, Antiplatelet agents, Opioid analgesics, Proton pump inhibitors, Thyroid hormones (These medications are commonly prescribed to manage co-existing cardiovascular conditions, pain, and other age-related comorbidities in patients on warfarin.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_acetaminophen,Clinical description,"Acetaminophen use encompasses individuals taking the medication for its analgesic and antipyretic properties, often to manage pain or fever associated with various underlying conditions. Its widespread use is primarily driven by its availability as an over-the-counter medication for self-treatment of mild to moderate pain and fever.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_acetaminophen,Frequency,Acetaminophen use is very common. Cases are easily identifiable in real-world health care data due to its widespread use and documentation in prescriptions and patient records.,cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_acetaminophen,Median age of incident cases,"45 to 65 (Individuals typically present in middle to older age, as these age groups experience more musculoskeletal pain and chronic conditions requiring pain relief.)",cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_acetaminophen,Percentage male,"45% to 55% (The proportion of males and females using acetaminophen is expected to be relatively balanced, with a slight tendency for higher usage in females due to a higher prevalence of certain pain conditions.)",cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_acetaminophen,Survival at five years,"60% to 85% (Acetaminophen use is related to the underlying disease, rather than being a direct cause of death, so survival is dependent on the condition being treated.)",cohort_survival,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_acetaminophen,Cohort overlap,The overlap with warfarin is expected to be low (5-15%) as they may be cautioned against concomitant use. The overlap with morphine (10-20%) may be present in some patients for pain management. There is little expected overlap with measurement of prostate specific antigen level (<5%) because this lab test is not related to the conditions for which acetaminophen is usually prescribed.,compare_cohorts,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_acetaminophen,Cohort timing,"Individuals may enter the acetaminophen cohort first for pain management. If they also appear in the morphine cohort, they are likely to enter the acetaminophen cohort first, followed by morphine if pain is not well controlled with acetaminophen (days to months later). If they also appear in the warfarin cohort, the timing of entry is less predictable, but could be concomitant or separate by months or years, depending on when anticoagulation becomes necessary. For measurement of prostate specific antigen level, the entry to the acetaminophen cohort would typically precede the measurement by years, although there is no direct relationship.",compare_cohorts,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_acetaminophen,Frequently seen comorbidities,"Hypertension, Osteoarthritis, Diabetes Mellitus, Ischemic Heart Disease, Chronic Kidney Disease, Heart Failure, Depression, Anxiety, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (These comorbidities are common in the general adult population who are more likely to use acetaminophen for pain management related to these conditions.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash

user_of_morphine,Clinical description,"Morphine use indicates the administration of a potent opioid analgesic, typically prescribed for the management of moderate to severe pain arising from acute injuries, post-operative states, chronic conditions like cancer, or palliative care. The aetiology of morphine use is directly linked to the underlying condition causing pain, as it does not treat the disease itself but rather alleviates the associated discomfort.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_morphine,Frequency,"Morphine use is relatively common, especially in hospital settings and among patients with chronic pain; therefore, cases are readily identifiable in real-world healthcare data.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_morphine,Median age of incident cases,"60 to 75 (Individuals typically present for morphine prescription later in life, when chronic pain conditions and cancer become more prevalent.)",cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_morphine,Percentage male,"40% to 60% (The proportion of males and females prescribed morphine is likely to be relatively balanced, although there may be a slight predominance in males due to higher rates of certain injuries and conditions.)",cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_morphine,Survival at five years,20% to 60% (Five-year survival is highly variable and dependent on the underlying condition requiring morphine; patients with cancer or severe heart conditions will have lower survival rates.),cohort_survival,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_morphine,Cohort overlap,Overlap with user_of_warfarin is expected to be 5-15% because both are more common in older patients. Overlap with user_of_acetaminophen is expected to be 20-40% as both are common analgesics. Overlap with measurement_of_prostate_specific_antigen_level is expected to be 5-15% as this test is specific to older men who may also have pain conditions.,compare_cohorts,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_morphine,Cohort timing,"Individuals might enter the acetaminophen cohort roughly concurrently with morphine (within days or weeks) for pain management. Entry into the warfarin cohort might precede or follow morphine initiation by months or years, depending on the onset of conditions requiring anticoagulation. Entry into the measurement_of_prostate_specific_antigen_level cohort will likely precede morphine use by years as screening guidelines suggest regular testing from age 50, whilst morphine use is more common later in life.",compare_cohorts,gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_morphine,Frequently seen comorbidities,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Osteoarthritis, Depression, Anxiety, Hypertension, Diabetes mellitus, Ischemic heart disease, Back pain, Neuropathic pain, Cancer (These comorbidities are commonly seen in individuals requiring morphine due to the increased risk of chronic pain conditions and other health issues that often necessitate opioid pain management.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_morphine,Frequently seen signs and symptoms,"Pain, Constipation, Nausea, Vomiting, Sedation, Dizziness, Confusion, Respiratory depression, Pruritus, Urinary retention (These signs and symptoms are commonly associated with morphine use due to its effects on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
user_of_morphine,Frequently seen medications,"Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, Gabapentin, Pregabalin, Amitriptyline, Sertraline, Amlodipine, Metoprolol, Omeprazole, Warfarin (These medications are frequently co-prescribed with morphine to manage pain, treat side effects, or address underlying comorbid conditions.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
measurement_of_prostate_specific_antigen_level,Clinical description,"Measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level is often conducted to screen for prostate cancer, a disease where abnormal cells grow in the prostate gland, or to monitor its progression or recurrence. Elevated PSA levels can indicate prostate cancer but can also be due to other conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia or prostatitis.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
measurement_of_prostate_specific_antigen_level,Frequency,"PSA testing is frequently performed in older men, especially in primary care settings; expect to identify a substantial number of cases in real-world health care data.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
measurement_of_prostate_specific_antigen_level,Median age of incident cases,60 to 75 (PSA testing is more common in older men as the risk of prostate cancer increases with age.),cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
measurement_of_prostate_specific_antigen_level,Percentage male,99% to 100% (PSA testing is almost exclusively performed in males due to the physiology of the prostate gland.),cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
measurement_of_prostate_specific_antigen_level,Survival at five years,"60% to 95% (Survival rates vary widely depending on the underlying cause of PSA elevation and the specific treatments received, but can reflect the overall health of the individual and the successful management of prostate cancer if present.)",cohort_survival,gemini-2.0-flash
measurement_of_prostate_specific_antigen_level,Cohort overlap,"Overlap with warfarin is expected in 5-15% of cases due to age-related conditions; acetaminophen use could overlap in 20-40% of cases for pain management; morphine overlap is less common at 1-5%, typically for severe pain. These overlaps reflect the management of various conditions alongside potential prostate issues.",compare_cohorts,gemini-2.0-flash
measurement_of_prostate_specific_antigen_level,Cohort timing,"Individuals may be on warfarin, acetaminophen, or morphine for years before PSA testing due to other conditions, so entry into those cohorts is likely to precede entry into the PSA testing cohort by months to years. Conversely, some may start these medications after a concerning PSA result, leading to entry into the other cohorts after the PSA testing cohort.",compare_cohorts,gemini-2.0-flash
measurement_of_prostate_specific_antigen_level,Frequently seen comorbidities,"Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Benign prostatic hyperplasia, Osteoarthritis, Ischemic heart disease, Chronic kidney disease, Depression, Obesity, Erectile dysfunction (These comorbidities are common in older men and can be related to lifestyle factors, age-related physiological changes, and hormonal influences.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
