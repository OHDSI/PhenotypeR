</h2>
<p>We use PhenotypeR to help assess the research readiness of a set of
study cohorts. To help make such assessments it can help to have an
explicit set of expectations to compare our results. For example, is the
age of our study cohort similar to what would be expected? Is the
proportion of the cohort that is male vs female similar to what would be
expected based on what we know about the phenotype of interest?</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="creating-phenotype-expectations">Creating phenotype expectations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#creating-phenotype-expectations"></a>
</h3>
<p>We can define a set of expectations about what we expect to see in
our phenotype diagnostic results. So that we can visualise these easily
using the <code><a href="../reference/tableCohortExpectations.html">tableCohortExpectations()</a></code> function, we will
create a tibble with the following columns: cohort_name (so we know
which expectation corresponds to which cohort), estimate (the estimate
for which our expectation is associated with), value (our expectation on
the value we should see in our results). As an example, say we have one
cohort called “knee_osteoarthritis” and another called
“knee_replacement”. We could create expectations about median age and
the proportion that is male for each cohort like so.</p>

</h3>
<p>The custom expectations created above might be based on our (or a
friendly colleagues’) clinical knowledge. This though requires access to
the requisite clinical knowledge and is often time-consuming, especially
if we have many cohorts and start considering the many different
estimates from phenotype diagnostics.</p>
<p>To speed up the process we can use an LLM to help us draft our
expectations. We could use this to create a custom set. Here for example
we’ll use Google Gemini to populate our expectations.</p>
<p>Notice that you may need first to create a Gemini API to run the
example. You can do that following this link: <a href="https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey" class="external-link uri">https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey</a>. And then add the
API in your R environment:</p>

These are the names passed to the LLM and so the more informative the
name, the better we can expect the LLM to do when generating our
expectations. In general to make them amenable to the LLM workflow when
naming cohorts we should:</p>
<ul>
<li>avoid abbreviations as they could be misinterpreted</li>
<li>indicate type of cohort
(e.g. “incident_diagnosis_of_knee_osteoarthritis”,
“routine_measurement_of_creatine”, “new_user_of_paracetamol”)</li>
<li>include key eligibility criteria
(e.g. “new_user_of_paracetamol_under_age_21”)</li>
</ul>
<p>It should also go without saying that we should not treat the output
of the LLM as the unequivocal truth. While LLM expectations may well
prove a useful starting point, clinical judgement and knowledge of the
data source at hand will still be vital in appropriately interpreting
our results. Our typical workflow may well be using LLMs to help
generate phenotype expectations for review by a clinical expert which
should save them time while ensuring we have an appropriate set to
compare our results against.</p>
