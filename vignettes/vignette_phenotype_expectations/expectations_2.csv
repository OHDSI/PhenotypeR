ankle_sprain,Clinical description,"Ankle sprain involves injury to the ligaments surrounding the ankle, typically caused by a sudden twist or excessive force that stretches or tears these ligaments. This often occurs during sports activities, missteps, or falls, leading to instability and pain.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
ankle_sprain,Frequency,"Ankle sprains are very common, especially in active populations, and are frequently encountered in healthcare settings.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
ankle_sprain,Median age of incident cases,15 to 35 (Ankle sprains are most common in young adults and athletes due to higher participation in activities that increase risk.),cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
ankle_sprain,Percentage male,50% to 70% (Males tend to experience more ankle sprains due to greater participation in high-impact sports and physical activities.),cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
ankle_sprain,Survival at five years,"100% to 100% (Ankle sprains do not directly impact survival rates, as they are musculoskeletal injuries with very low mortality.)",cohort_survival,gemini-2.0-flash
ankle_sprain,Frequently seen comorbidities,"Obesity, Osteoarthritis, Chronic ankle instability, Ligamentous laxity, Peripheral neuropathy, Generalized joint hypermobility syndrome, Flat feet, High arches, Muscle weakness, Balance disorders (These comorbidities can either predispose individuals to ankle sprains due to biomechanical instability or develop as a consequence of repeated sprains and altered gait.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
ankle_sprain,Frequently seen signs and symptoms,"Pain, Swelling, Bruising, Limited range of motion, Tenderness to touch, Instability, Difficulty bearing weight, Stiffness, Popping sensation, Muscle spasm (These signs and symptoms directly result from the ligament damage, inflammation, and the body's response to the injury.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
ankle_sprain,Frequently seen medications,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, Acetaminophen, Opioid analgesics, Topical NSAIDs, Muscle relaxants, Chondroprotective agents, Corticosteroids, Antidepressants, Nerve pain medication, Anticoagulants (Medications are used to manage pain, inflammation, and associated nerve pain following ankle sprains, also accounting for pre-existing conditions.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
morphine,Clinical description,"Morphine is an opioid analgesic used to relieve severe pain, often associated with tissue injury, surgery, or cancer, by binding to opioid receptors in the central nervous system and reducing the perception of pain.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
morphine,Frequency,"Morphine use is relatively common, especially in inpatient settings and for palliative care, so identification in real-world healthcare data is expected.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
morphine,Median age of incident cases,60 to 75 (Morphine is more commonly prescribed to older adults due to a higher prevalence of chronic pain and age-related conditions.),cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
morphine,Percentage male,50% to 65% (Men are more likely to be prescribed morphine due to a higher incidence of certain types of injuries and chronic pain conditions.),cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
morphine,Survival at five years,30% to 70% (Survival rates vary widely depending on the underlying conditions requiring morphine treatment; patients with cancer or severe cardiovascular disease will have lower survival rates than those with chronic pain alone.),cohort_survival,gemini-2.0-flash
morphine,Frequently seen comorbidities,"Chronic pain, Depression, Anxiety, Opioid use disorder, Osteoarthritis, Back pain, Neuropathy, Insomnia, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Cardiovascular disease (Morphine is often prescribed for chronic pain, which is frequently associated with mental health conditions, musculoskeletal issues, respiratory issues and cardiovascular problems.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
morphine,Frequently seen signs and symptoms,"Constipation, Nausea, Vomiting, Drowsiness, Confusion, Respiratory depression, Pruritus, Urinary retention, Dizziness, Hypotension (These signs and symptoms are common side effects of morphine due to its effects on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
morphine,Frequently seen medications,"Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, Gabapentin, Amitriptyline, Sertraline, Omeprazole, Metoprolol, Amlodipine, Warfarin, Bisacodyl (Patients on morphine often take other analgesics, medications for nerve pain, antidepressants, gastrointestinal medications, and cardiovascular drugs.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
prostate_cancer,Clinical description,"Prostate cancer is a malignant tumor that develops in the prostate gland, often driven by hormonal factors and genetic predispositions leading to uncontrolled cell growth. The disease typically manifests as adenocarcinoma arising from the glandular cells of the prostate.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
prostate_cancer,Frequency,"Prostate cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in men, and cases are commonly identified in real-world health care data.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
prostate_cancer,Median age of incident cases,65 to 72 (Prostate cancer is predominantly diagnosed in older men.),cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
prostate_cancer,Percentage male,100% to 100% (Prostate cancer exclusively affects males due to the presence of the prostate gland.),cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
prostate_cancer,Survival at five years,"85% to 98% (Five-year survival rates are generally high due to screening and treatment advances, but can vary based on stage and grade at diagnosis.)",cohort_survival,gemini-2.0-flash
prostate_cancer,Frequently seen comorbidities,"Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Benign prostatic hyperplasia, Osteoarthritis, Ischemic heart disease, Chronic kidney disease, Depression, Obesity, Erectile dysfunction (These comorbidities are common in older men and may share risk factors with prostate cancer, or arise as a consequence of treatment.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
prostate_cancer,Frequently seen signs and symptoms,"Urinary frequency, Nocturia, Weak urine stream, Hesitancy, Urgency, Dysuria, Hematuria, Erectile dysfunction, Bone pain, Lower back pain (These signs and symptoms arise due to the tumor's impact on the prostate gland and surrounding structures, or from metastatic spread to the bones.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
prostate_cancer,Frequently seen medications,"Androgen deprivation therapy, Alpha-blockers, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, Bisphosphonates, Analgesics, Antidepressants, Antihypertensives, Statins, Chemotherapy, Corticosteroids (These medications address prostate cancer itself, manage side effects of treatment, or treat common co-existing conditions.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
