ankle sprain,Clinical description,"Ankle sprain is an injury to the ligaments surrounding the ankle, typically caused by a sudden twisting or inversion of the foot. This often occurs during sports or other physical activities, leading to damage or tearing of the ligaments.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
ankle sprain,Frequency,"Ankle sprains are a common musculoskeletal injury, and they are frequently encountered in real-world health care data.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
ankle sprain,Median age of incident cases,15 to 35 (Ankle sprains commonly occur in active young adults and athletes.),cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
ankle sprain,Percentage male,50% to 70% (Males tend to participate in higher-risk sports and activities that predispose them to ankle sprains.),cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
ankle sprain,Survival at five years,"95% to 99% (Ankle sprains are generally not life-threatening, so survival rates are expected to be very high and comparable to the general population.)",cohort_survival,gemini-2.0-flash
ankle sprain,Frequently seen comorbidities,"Obesity, Osteoarthritis, Peripheral neuropathy, Diabetes mellitus, Hypertension, Chronic kidney disease, Depression, Anxiety, Gout, Plantar fasciitis (These comorbidities are commonly seen alongside ankle sprains due to shared risk factors such as physical activity levels, age-related joint degeneration, and systemic conditions affecting tissue health and pain perception.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
ankle sprain,Frequently seen signs and symptoms,"Pain, Swelling, Bruising, Tenderness to touch, Limited range of motion, Difficulty walking, Instability, Stiffness, Popping sensation, Muscle spasm (These signs and symptoms directly result from the ligament damage, inflammation, and associated tissue responses in the injured ankle joint.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
ankle sprain,Frequently seen medications,"Ibuprofen, Naproxen, Acetaminophen, Oxycodone, Tramadol, Gabapentin, Amitriptyline, Diazepam, Cyclobenzaprine, Topical diclofenac (These medications are commonly used for pain relief, inflammation reduction, and muscle relaxation associated with ankle sprains.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
prostate cancer,Clinical description,"Prostate cancer arises from the uncontrolled growth of cells within the prostate gland, often driven by hormonal factors, genetic predisposition, and environmental influences. This leads to the formation of tumors that can disrupt normal prostate function and potentially metastasize to other parts of the body.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
prostate cancer,Frequency,"Prostate cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in men, and we can expect to identify a substantial number of cases in real-world healthcare data. Its high prevalence makes it a significant health concern.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
prostate cancer,Median age of incident cases,"65 to 75 (The risk of prostate cancer increases with age, with most cases diagnosed in men over 65.)",cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
prostate cancer,Percentage male,99% to 100% (Prostate cancer is almost exclusively diagnosed in males due to the presence of the prostate gland.),cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
prostate cancer,Survival at five years,"30% to 98% (Survival rates vary greatly depending on the stage and grade of the cancer at diagnosis, as well as the treatment approach and the patient's overall health.)",cohort_survival,gemini-2.0-flash
prostate cancer,Frequently seen comorbidities,"Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia, Type 2 Diabetes, Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, Ischemic Heart Disease, Osteoarthritis, Obesity, Chronic Kidney Disease, Depression, Peripheral Vascular Disease (These comorbidities are common in older men, who are also at higher risk for prostate cancer, reflecting age-related physiological changes and lifestyle factors.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
prostate cancer,Frequently seen signs and symptoms,"Frequent Urination, Nocturia, Weak Urine Stream, Hesitancy, Urgency, Hematuria, Erectile Dysfunction, Bone Pain, Lower Back Pain, Unexplained Weight Loss (These signs and symptoms arise from the local effects of the tumor on the urinary tract and, in advanced stages, from metastasis to the bones and other organs.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
prostate cancer,Frequently seen medications,"Alpha-Blockers, 5-Alpha Reductase Inhibitors, Luteinizing Hormone-Releasing Hormone Agonists, Anti-Androgens, Bisphosphonates, Analgesics, Antidepressants, Statins, Antihypertensives, Bone-Modifying Agents (These medications reflect treatments for prostate cancer itself, management of side effects from cancer treatment, and concurrent management of common comorbidities.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
morphine,Clinical description,"Morphine is an opioid analgesic used to relieve severe pain, often stemming from tissue injury, surgery, or cancer-related pain pathways.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
morphine,Frequency,"Morphine use is relatively common, particularly in hospital settings and for managing chronic pain, so identification in real-world health data is expected.",cohort_count,gemini-2.0-flash
morphine,Median age of incident cases,55 to 75 (Individuals typically present in middle to older adulthood when chronic pain conditions and cancer become more prevalent.),cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
morphine,Percentage male,"45% to 60% (Men are slightly more likely to be prescribed opioids for pain management, although prevalence is high across both sexes.)",cohort_characteristics,gemini-2.0-flash
morphine,Survival at five years,"30% to 70% (Survival rates vary significantly based on the underlying conditions necessitating morphine use, with serious illnesses impacting long-term prognosis.)",cohort_survival,gemini-2.0-flash
morphine,Frequently seen comorbidities,"Opioid-related disorder, Anxiety, Depression, Chronic pain, Osteoarthritis, Back pain, Insomnia, Gastroesophageal reflux disease, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia (These comorbidities reflect common conditions associated with chronic pain, opioid use, and potential side effects or lifestyle factors.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
morphine,Frequently seen signs and symptoms,"Constipation, Nausea, Vomiting, Drowsiness, Dizziness, Confusion, Respiratory depression, Pruritus, Urinary retention, Miosis (These signs and symptoms are typical side effects of morphine and other opioid medications due to their effects on the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
morphine,Frequently seen medications,"Acetaminophen, Ibuprofen, Gabapentin, Pregabalin, Amitriptyline, Sertraline, Omeprazole, Metoprolol, Atorvastatin, Warfarin (These medications are commonly used to manage pain, nerve-related symptoms, mental health conditions, and other co-existing chronic diseases.)","large_scale_characteristics, compare_large_scale_characteristics",gemini-2.0-flash
