## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(CDMConnector)
library(phenotypeR)
library(CohortConstructor)
library(dplyr)

con <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(dbdir = CDMConnector::eunomia_dir()))
cdm <- CDMConnector::cdm_from_con(con = con,
                      cdm_schema = "main",
                      write_schema = "main")

cdm$gibleed <- conceptCohort(cdm = cdm,
                                   conceptSet = list(gibleed = 192671L),
                                   name = "gibleed")

result <- cdm$gibleed |>
   phenotypeCohort()

result |> 
  glimpse()

```
