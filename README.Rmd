The phenotypeR package takes a cohort table in a cdm reference and runs
a series of analyses, including summaries of:  
- code counts in the cdm,  
- counts of codes that could have led to cohort inclusion,  
- cohort overlap and timing (when there is more than one cohort),  
- trends in incidence and prevalence,  
- the demographics of the individuals in a cohort, and    
- the cohort compared to indivduals matched on age and sex.  

Once you have obtained the results, you can view them in  
- a shiny application, and/ or  
- a parameterised report  

## Installation

You can install the development version of phenotypeR like so:

.....

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(CDMConnector)
library(phenotypeR)
library(CohortConstructor)
library(dplyr)

con <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(dbdir = CDMConnector::eunomia_dir()))
cdm <- CDMConnector::cdm_from_con(con = con,
                      cdm_schema = "main",
                      write_schema = "main")

cdm$gibleed <- conceptCohort(cdm = cdm,
                                   conceptSet = list(gibleed = 192671L),
                                   name = "gibleed")

result <- cdm$gibleed |>
   phenotypeCohort()

result
```
