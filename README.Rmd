The PhenotypeR package helps us to assess the research-readiness of a
set of cohorts we have defined. This assessment includes:

-   ***Database diagnostics*** which help us to better understand the
    database in which they have been created. This includes information
    about the size of the data, the time period covered, the number of
    people in the data as a whole. More granular information that may
    influence analytic decisions, such as the number of observation
    periods per person, is also described.\
-   ***Codelist diagnostics*** which help to answer questions like what
    concepts from our codelist are used in the database? What concepts
    were present led to individuals' entry in the cohort? Are there any
    concepts being used in the database that we didn't include in our
    codelist but maybe we should have?\
-   ***Cohort diagnostics*** which help to answer questions like how
    many individuals did we include in our cohort and how many were
    excluded because of our inclusion criteria? If we have multiple
    cohorts, is there overlap between them and when do people enter one
    cohort relative to another? What is the incidence of cohort entry
    and what is the prevalence of the cohort in the database?\
-   ***Matched diagnostics*** which compares our study cohorts to the
    overall population in the database. By matching people in the
    cohorts to people with a similar age and sex in the database we can
    see how our cohorts differ from the general database population.\
-   ***Population diagnostics*** which estimates the frequency of our
    study cohorts in the database in terms of their incidence rates and
    prevalence.

## Installation

You can install PhenotypeR from CRAN:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("PhenotypeR")
```

Or you can install the development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("OHDSI/PhenotypeR")
```

## Example usage

To illustrate the functionalities of PhenotypeR, let's create a cohort
using the Eunomia dataset. We'll first load the required packages and
create the cdm reference for the data.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(CDMConnector)
library(PhenotypeR)
library(CodelistGenerator)
library(CohortConstructor)
library(dplyr)
library(OmopSketch)
library(CohortCharacteristics)

```

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Connect to the database and create the cdm object
con <- DBI::dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), eunomiaDir("synpuf-1k", "5.3"))
cdm <- cdmFromCon(con = con, 
                  cdmSchema   = "main",
                  writeSchema = "main", 
                  achillesSchema = "main")

# Create a code lists
cond_codes <- list("gastrointestinal_hemorrhage" = c(192671, 4338544, 4100660, 4307661),
                   "asthma" = c(317009, 257581))

# Instantiate cohorts with CohortConstructor
cdm$conditions <- conceptCohort(cdm = cdm,
                                conceptSet = cond_codes, 
                                exit = "event_end_date",
                                overlap = "merge",
                                name = "conditions")
```

We can easily run all the analyses explained above (**database
diagnostics**, **codelist diagnostics**, **cohort diagnostics**,
**matched diagnostics**, and **population diagnostics**) using
`phenotypeDiagnostics()`:

```{r, message = FALSE}

result <- phenotypeDiagnostics(cdm$conditions)

# See all the results generated:
result |> 
  settings() |>
  select("result_type")

```

Once we have our results we can quickly view them in an interactive
application. This shiny app will be saved in a new directory and can be
further customised using the `directory` input.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

shinyDiagnostics(result = result, directory = tempdir())

```

See the shiny app generated from the example cohort in
[here](https://dpa-pde-oxford.shinyapps.io/Readme_PhenotypeR/).
