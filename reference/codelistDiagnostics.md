# Run codelist-level diagnostics

\`codelistDiagnostics()\` runs phenotypeR diagnostics on the
cohort_codelist attribute on the cohort. Thus codelist attribute of the
cohort must be populated. If it is missing then it could be populated
using \`addCodelistAttribute()\` function.

Furthermore \`codelistDiagnostics()\` requires achilles tables to be
present in the cdm so that concept counts could be derived.

## Usage

``` r
codelistDiagnostics(cohort)
```

## Arguments

- cohort:

  A cohort table in a cdm reference. The cohort_codelist attribute must
  be populated. The cdm reference must contain achilles tables as these
  will be used for deriving concept counts.

## Value

A summarised result

## Examples

``` r
# \donttest{
library(omock)
library(CohortConstructor)
library(PhenotypeR)

cdm <- mockCdmFromDataset(source = "duckdb")
#> ℹ Reading GiBleed tables.
#> ℹ Adding drug_strength table.
#> ℹ Creating local <cdm_reference> object.
#> ℹ Inserting <cdm_reference> into duckdb.
