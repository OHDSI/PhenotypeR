# Create a shiny app summarising your phenotyping results

A shiny app that is designed for any diagnostics results from
phenotypeR, this includes:

\* A diagnostics on the database via \`databaseDiagnostics\`. \* A
diagnostics on the cohort_codelist attribute of the cohort via
\`codelistDiagnostics\`. \* A diagnostics on the cohort via
\`cohortDiagnostics\`. \* A diagnostics on the population via
\`populationDiagnostics\`. \* A diagnostics on the matched cohort via
\`matchedDiagnostics\`.

## Usage

``` r
shinyDiagnostics(
  result,
  directory,
  minCellCount = 5,
  open = rlang::is_interactive(),
  expectations = NULL,
  removeEmptyTabs = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- result:

  A summarised result

- directory:

  Directory where to save report

- minCellCount:

  Minimum cell count for suppression when exporting results.

- open:

  If TRUE, the shiny app will be launched in a new session. If FALSE,
  the shiny app will be created but not launched.

- expectations:

  Data frame or tibble with cohort expectations. It must contain the
  following columns: cohort_name, estimate, value, and source.

- removeEmptyTabs:

  Whether to remove tabs of those diagnostics that have not been
  performed or that were insufficient counts to produce a result (TRUE)
  or not (FALSE)

## Value

A shiny app
